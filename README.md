Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions
This step involves reviewing all browser extensions installed on the user's system to detect and remove any that pose a potential security risk. Suspicious extensions may include those that:  

Are not recognized or were not intentionally installed by the user.

Request excessive or unnecessary permissions, such as access to all website data, clipboard contents, or user location.

Have poor user reviews, low ratings, or are no longer available in the official web store.

Have been recently flagged in cybersecurity threat intelligence feeds or news sources.

Redirect search results, inject ads, or display behavior typical of adware, spyware, or browser hijackers.

Appear to be clones of legitimate extensions, often mimicking names or logos.

Actions Performed:

Opened the extensions management page in each installed browser (e.g., chrome://extensions, about:addons, etc.).

Documented all active extensions.

Evaluated each based on name, developer, permissions, and user feedback.

Removed or disabled any extension identified as malicious, suspicious, or unnecessary.

Reset browser settings if any extension altered default configurations (e.g., homepage, search engine).

This process helps reduce the risk of data breaches, phishing, and unauthorized tracking by ensuring that only trusted, necessary extensions remain active in the browser.
